# Snake game built in javaScript

## Objective:
The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat food and grow as long as possible without colliding with walls or its own body.

## Controls:
The player controls the movement of the snake using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or other designated keys or controls.

## Snake Movement:
The snake moves in a grid-based environment, with each grid cell representing a position on the game board. The snake always moves in a single direction at any given time.

## Food:
There is food randomly placed on the game board. When the snake's head collides with the food, it eats the food, and its length increases by one segment.

## Growing:
As the snake eats food, it grows longer. The new segment is added to the end of the snake's tail.

## Collision with Walls:
If the snake collides with any of the four walls of the game board, the game ends, and the player loses.

## Collision with Snake's Body:
If the snake's head collides with any part of its own body, the game ends, and the player loses. The snake cannot move through its own body.

## Scoring:
The score of the player is usually determined by the length of the snake. Each time the snake eats food, the score increases.

## Game Over:
The game is over when the snake collides with a wall or its own body. At this point, the player can see their final score and may have the option to restart the game.
